# **Collection of Different Algorithms Implemented in Various Programming Languages as a part of my MCA 2nd Semester Curriculum, possibly with detailed explainations too :P**

> Green Checks in front of algorithm names denotes that they have been implemented.

> This is an overview of included data structures that are implemented, more information about each structure and implementation is provided in their own README.md included inside folders and programs.
